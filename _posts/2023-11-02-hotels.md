Bonn is a relatively small city and most hotels in the city would be within a 30 minute drive either by taxi/uber or public transporation. However, here we list some hotels we would recommend for convenience.

## V-Hotel
More on the expensive side, a doble room costs around EUR 180. It's a a 10-minute walk to the wedding location.

## Dorint Venusberg Bonn
Location is good, on the mountain/hill of the wedding location but it's not as close, this would be a 30-minute walk through the forest or a short taxi drive.
